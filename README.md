3. Update system packages:
```bash
apt update -y
apt upgrade -y
```

4. Install required dependencies:
```bash
apt install curl gnupg2 wget -y
```

5. Add Jitsi Meet repository:
```bash
curl https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key -o jitsi-key.gpg.key
gpg --output /usr/share/keyrings/jitsi-key.gpg --dearmor jitsi-key.gpg.key
```

6. Create Jitsi repository file:
```bash
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jitsi-key.gpg] https://download.jitsi.org stable/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list
```

7. Install Jitsi Meet:
```bash
apt install jitsi-meet -y
```

8. Configure SSL certificate:
- Choose Let's Encrypt during installation
- Enter your METUnic domain name
- Provide email address for notifications

9. Enable authentication:
```bash
nano /etc/prosody/conf.avail/your-domain.cfg.lua
```
Add authentication configuration:
```lua
authentication = "internal_plain"
```

10. Create admin user:
```bash
prosodyctl register admin your-domain.com yourpassword
```
